# AIKnowledgeExtractor  

AIKnowledgeExtractor is a simple tool to pull out and organize information from any kind of text, bit by bit.  

## What’s the Plan?  
- Use an LLM to handle the extraction, generating structured outputs based on user requests.
- Process texts iteratively, working through chunks step by step.  
- Work with stories, books, reports—basically any text.  
- Save everything neatly in a structured format.  

This is just the beginning—more to come as it takes shape!
